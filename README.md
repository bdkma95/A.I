# Traffic Sign Classification: Experimentation Process

## Initial Model
I started with a basic CNN model consisting of two convolutional layers followed by max pooling, and two dense layers. This initial model achieved an accuracy of about 85% on the test set.

## Experimentation

### Increasing Model Complexity
1. Added a third convolutional layer: This improved accuracy to 88%.
2. Increased the number of filters in each convolutional layer: Slight improvement to 89%.
3. Added more dense layers: No significant improvement, increased training time.

### Regularization Techniques
1. Implemented dropout (0.5 after first dense layer, 0.3 after second): Reduced overfitting, improved generalization.
2. Added L2 regularization to dense layers: Slight improvement in generalization, but increased training time.

### Data Augmentation
1. Implemented random rotations and flips: Improved model robustness, accuracy increased to 91%.
2. Added random brightness adjustments: Further improved to 92%.

### Learning Rate Tuning
1. Experimented with different learning rates: Found 0.001 to work best for my model.
2. Implemented learning rate decay: Helped in fine-tuning towards the end of training.

## Observations
- Deeper networks generally performed better, but very deep networks (>5 conv layers) led to overfitting.
- Data augmentation was crucial in improving model generalization.
- Dropout was more effective than L2 regularization for this particular problem.
- Batch normalization helped in faster convergence but didn't significantly improve final accuracy.

## Best Performing Model
The model that performed best included:
- 3 convolutional layers with increasing filters (32, 64, 64)
- Max pooling after each convolutional layer
- 2 dense layers (128, 64 units) with dropout
- Data augmentation during training
- Adam optimizer with initial learning rate of 0.001 and decay

This model achieved a test accuracy of 93.5%.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with more advanced architectures like ResNet or Inception.
- Try more extensive data augmentation techniques.
- Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
