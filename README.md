Football Analytics Platform
Football Analytics

The Football Analytics Platform is a comprehensive system designed to collect, process, and analyze football (soccer) data. It integrates machine learning models, real-time data processing, and visualization tools to provide insights into player performance, injury risk, and match outcomes.

Features
Data Collection:

Fetch match data from the Football-Data.org API.

Retrieve weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.

Data Storage:

Store data in PostgreSQL.

Upload processed data to AWS S3.

Data Processing:

Clean and preprocess data.

Calculate advanced metrics like expected goals (xG) and pass accuracy.

Machine Learning:

Predict player injury risk using Random Forest.

Predict player ratings using regression models.

Cluster players based on performance metrics.

API Endpoints:

Provide passing suggestions via REST API.

Health check endpoint for monitoring.

Real-Time Updates:

Use Flask-SocketIO for real-time data updates.

Monitoring:

Track API requests and model predictions using Prometheus.

Visualize metrics using Grafana.

Asynchronous Tasks:

Use Celery for background task processing.

Technologies Used
Python Libraries:

Flask, Flask-SocketIO, Flask-Limiter, Flasgger

Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Stable-Baselines3

Psycopg2, Boto3, MLflow, Joblib

Prometheus, Grafana, Celery

Databases:

PostgreSQL

Redis (for Celery)

Cloud Services:

AWS S3

APIs:

Football-Data.org API

OpenWeatherMap API

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

PostgreSQL

Redis

AWS S3 Bucket

Docker (optional, for containerization)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/football-analytics.git
cd football-analytics
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

env
Copy
FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY=your_football_data_api_key
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
POSTGRES_DB=your_dbname
POSTGRES_USER=your_username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_HOST=your_host
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy
python app.py
Docker Setup
Build and run the application using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up --build
Access the services:

Flask App: http://localhost:5000

Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

Grafana: http://localhost:3000

Usage
API Endpoints
Passing Suggestions:

Endpoint: POST /passing-suggestions

Input: JSON payload with player data.

Example:

json
Copy
{
  "player_id": 123,
  "goals": 5,
  "assists": 3,
  "minutes_played": 450
}
Output:

json
Copy
{
  "message": "Improve passing accuracy under pressure."
}
Health Check:

Endpoint: GET /health

Output:

json
Copy
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
Machine Learning Models
Injury Risk Prediction:

Train the model:

python
Copy
injury_model = data_processor.train_injury_prediction_model(player_data)
Predict injury risk:

python
Copy
predictions = injury_model.predict(new_data)
Player Rating Prediction:

Train the model:

python
Copy
player_rating_model = data_processor.train_player_rating_model(player_data)
Predict player ratings:

python
Copy
ratings = player_rating_model.predict(new_data)
Monitoring
Prometheus:

Access metrics at http://localhost:9090.

Track API requests and model predictions.

Grafana:

Access dashboards at http://localhost:3000.

Visualize metrics like API request rate and model performance.
