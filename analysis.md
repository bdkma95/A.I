Layer 2, Head 3
Description: This attention head appears to focus on the relationship between nouns and their associated determiners. It shows a tendency to pay attention to determiners (like "the," "a," or "this") that precede the nouns they modify, indicating that it has learned to recognize how determiners specify or limit the nouns they are associated with.
Example Sentences:
"I saw the dog in the park."
"A cat jumped onto the table."
In both examples, the attention head emphasizes how the determiners "the" and "a" directly influence the nouns "dog" and "cat." This suggests that this attention head captures the syntactic relationship between determiners and nouns, which is crucial for understanding specificity in language.

Layer 4, Head 6
Description: This attention head seems to focus on the relationship between verbs and their subject pronouns. It tends to attend to the pronouns that precede action verbs, indicating an understanding of how subjects relate to actions in sentences.
Example Sentences:
"She runs every morning."
"They are going to the concert tonight."
In these sentences, the attention head highlights how the pronouns "She" and "They" are closely associated with their respective verbs "runs" and "are going." This indicates that this attention head has learned to recognize the relationship between subjects and their corresponding actions, which is key for sentence comprehension.
